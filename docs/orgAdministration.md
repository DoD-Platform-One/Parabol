# Org Administration

When a user signs up for Parabol, it will create a new organization for them based on their username (like Jordan's Org). They'll also get a personal 'Team' created for them that can house their private tasks (like Jordan's Team).

The way membership works in Parabol is any user can create a Team and invite other's to it. When they do, they'll become a member of the Organization that Team belongs two but will only have access to the data (Tasks & Meeting History) for their Teams.
